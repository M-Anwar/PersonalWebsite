#### Publications

The following are a list of my publications as a student, research assistant and researcher, organized by field.

##### Human Computer Interaction (HCI)

		        <strong>Porous Interfaces for Small Screen Multitasking using Finger Identification</strong>
		        <br>
	        	<i> Aakar Gupta, Muhammed Anwar, Ravin Balakrishnan</i>
	        	<br>
	        	<i> In UIST 2016 Proceedings </i>
	        	<br>
	        	The lack of dedicated multitasking interface features in smartphones has resulted in users attempting a sequential form of multitasking via frequent app switching. In addition to the obvious temporal cost, it requires physical and cognitive effort which increases multifold as the back and forth switching becomes more frequent. We propose porous interfaces, a paradigm that combines the concept of translucent windows with finger identification to support efficient multitasking on small screens.
