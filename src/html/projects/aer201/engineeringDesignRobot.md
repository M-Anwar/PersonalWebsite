##### AER201 - Engineering Design, 2nd Year Engineering Science Course 
		        
A full semester project where we conceptualized, designed and manufactured a Ping-Pong ball packing autonomous machine. My responsibility was to build all the electromechanical components of the machine and work with a group of 2 other people to make a fully functional robot. We finished in 2nd place among all the other teams participating in the design competition.
