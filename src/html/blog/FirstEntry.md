##### Welcome to my FIRST blog entry!

And we have liftoff! This is my first blog entry on this website. I look forward to adding more content to this as time goes by. That is, if I can gather up the patience and discipline to keep this up.

Anyway, these blog entries won't all be technical. They will ideally include opinion pieces, wonky experiments, and any other interesting observations I may have. Basically, anything too small to be considered a project will be added as a blog entry.

I also want to use these blogs, along with my other project pieces, as an opportunity to practice my writing and technical explanations. Being able to explain concepts clearly and precisely is an important skill in writing, and I wish to improve on these through this medium.

I have a few ideas moving forward, and when I get the time, Iâ€™ll write them up. 
See you back here soon!
