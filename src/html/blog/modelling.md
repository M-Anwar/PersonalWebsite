title: The Usefullness of 3D Modelling and Animation 
description: In this blog entry I talk about the usefulness of 3D modelling, giving particular examples from my undergraduate engineering career. I cover how I first started with 3D visualization, and how you can also begin learning this incredibly useful transferable skill. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then having the ability to sketch in 3D is truly an invaluable skill, useful to all regardless of their specialization. So the next time you have an incredible idea, draw it out … in 3D!
shortDescription: Express your ideas in 3D.

##### Welcome to my FIRST blog entry!

And we have liftoff! This is my first blog entry on this website. I look forward to adding more content to this as time goes by. That is, if I can gather up the patience and discipline to keep this up.

Anyway, these blog entries won't all be technical. They will ideally include opinion pieces, wonky experiments, and any other interesting observations I may have. Basically, anything too small to be considered a project will be added as a blog entry.

I also want to use these blogs, along with my other project pieces, as an opportunity to practice my writing and technical explanations. Being able to explain concepts clearly and precisely is an important skill in writing, and I wish to improve on these through this medium.

I have a few ideas moving forward, and when I get the time, I’ll write them up. 
See you back here soon!
